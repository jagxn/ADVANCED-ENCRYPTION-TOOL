DESCRIPTION :

This Python script provides secure file encryption and decryption using AES-256-CBC with HMAC-SHA256 for integrity verification. It allows users to encrypt sensitive files into an unreadable binary format and later decrypt them using a password. The tool uses scrypt for key derivation, ensuring strong protection against brute-force attacks. Users can run it via the command line by specifying encrypt or decrypt mode, input/output file paths, and a password (either entered interactively or passed as an argument). The encrypted output includes a salt, IV (Initialization Vector), and HMAC tag for security. If decryption fails due to tampering or wrong passwords, the script safely deletes incomplete output files.
